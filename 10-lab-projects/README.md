# C Lab Exercises

## Why this exists

This folder collects many smaller lab assignments from my C programming course.

## What this project shows

Together they show steady progress with loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and problem solving on course-style tasks.

## How to run (local)

Open this folder in your terminal and compile with GCC or your C compiler.

Single program example:
  gcc main.c -o app -mconsole
  ./app   (or .\app.exe on Windows)

For folders with multiple small programs:
  gcc file_name.c -o file_name.exe -mconsole
  .\file_name.exe
