# 2D Array Functions

## Why this exists

This project exists to practice working with 2D arrays (matrices) in C: reading input, printing nicely, and writing helper functions to operate on matrices.

## What this project shows

It shows that I can handle multi-dimensional array indexing, pass 2D arrays to functions via pointers, and separate logic into clear helper functions.

## How to run (local)

Open this folder in your terminal and compile with GCC or your C compiler.

Single program example:
  gcc main.c -o app -mconsole
  ./app   (or .\app.exe on Windows)

For folders with multiple small programs:
  gcc file_name.c -o file_name.exe -mconsole
  .\file_name.exe
