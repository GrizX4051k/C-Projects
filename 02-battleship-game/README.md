# Battleship Game

## Why this exists

This project exists as a full console implementation of the classic Battleship game.

## What this project shows

I use a 2D grid, random ship placement, input validation, and a structured game loop to manage turns and track hits and misses.

## How to run (local)

Open this folder in your terminal and compile with GCC or your C compiler.

Single program example:
  gcc main.c -o app -mconsole
  ./app   (or .\app.exe on Windows)

For folders with multiple small programs:
  gcc file_name.c -o file_name.exe -mconsole
  .\file_name.exe
