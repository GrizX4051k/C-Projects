# Hello World

## Why this exists

This is my first C program: the classic Hello World example.

## What this project shows

It marks the starting point of this C journey and shows the basic structure of a C program and the compile and run workflow.

## How to run (local)

Open this folder in your terminal and compile with GCC or your C compiler.

Single program example:
  gcc main.c -o app -mconsole
  ./app   (or .\app.exe on Windows)

For folders with multiple small programs:
  gcc file_name.c -o file_name.exe -mconsole
  .\file_name.exe
