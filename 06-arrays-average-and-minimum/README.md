# Arrays: Average and Minimum

## Why this exists

This folder holds helper functions for computing the average and minimum of values stored in arrays.

## What this project shows

It proves I can pass arrays to functions, design reusable utilities, and separate interface (.h) from implementation (.c).

## How to run (local)

Open this folder in your terminal and compile with GCC or your C compiler.

Single program example:
  gcc main.c -o app -mconsole
  ./app   (or .\app.exe on Windows)

For folders with multiple small programs:
  gcc file_name.c -o file_name.exe -mconsole
  .\file_name.exe
